# MAF - Modular Automation Framework
An expandable fast, easy to use automation framework built in the cucumber language.  Supports API Testing and SQL Testing in a simple manner.  Allows the usage of modules in isolation as well as in an integrated fashion.  Utilizes the cucumber language to clearly articulate intent while preserving test data for further debugging and record-keeping.  Allows the integration of custom modules and provides a core to allow for simple integration between components.

## Installation
Dependencies
- node

Create a new npm project using `npm init` and install the following dependencies:
```
npm i @cucumber/cucumber --save-dev
npm i @ln-maf/aws --save-dev
npm i @ln-maf/validations --save-dev
npm i @ln-maf/api --save-dev
npm i @ln-maf/mysql --save-dev
npm i @ln-maf/core --save-dev
npm i multiple-cucumber-html-reporter --save-dev
```

Then create a features directory `mkdir features` with the following in `features/steps.js` file:
```
require('@ln-maf/core/parameter_types')
require('@ln-maf/aws')
require('@ln-maf/validations')
require('@ln-maf/api')
require('@ln-maf/mysql')
```
Doing this indicates that these modules steps and [parameter types](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/#parameter-types) are available to use by cucumber.

Modify the `package.json` to use cucumber:
```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cucumber-js --format json > test/report/report.json; node node_modules/@ln-maf/core/multiReport"
  },
```

Please also create a directory to store your test results in the root of your project.  To match the above and the below multiReport please run:
```
mkdir -p test/report
```

Now, when you run `npm t` you should be able to view your test results in a nice looking report.

## Hello World API Example

`./features/HelloWorldAPI.feature`
```
Feature: View the text "Hello World"
  Scenario: Hello World
    When perform api request:
    """
    {
      "url": "http://www.mocky.io/v2/",
      "api": "5ec540242f00004cb1dc30dd",
      "method": "GET"
    }
    """
    Then status ok
    And item "response" is equal to "Hello World"
```

### The Generated report:
```
âžœ  mafMonoRepo git:(master) bash runFeature.sh helloWorld.feature
...

1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)

## Hello World SQL Example

This requires the setup of your sql environment.  To utilize this, please run `node sqlConfigure` and it will prompt you for needed credentials, etc. for SQL to run properly.    It will store the config in a `sqlConfig.json` file and it will store your credentials using `node-keytar` which uses your OS's secure password storage:
- Windows - Credential Vault
- MacOS - KeyChain
- Linux - libSecret

You will also need to update the sql query and update the validations to match.  You can copy the validations from the generated report to make sure it passes.

`features/HelloWorldSQL.feature`
```
Feature: SQL Hello World
  Scenario: Run a query
      When mysql query from string "SELECT * FROM HelloWorld" is run
      Then it matches set from the file "helloWorldSQL.json"
```
`./helloWorldSQL.json`
```
[
  {
    "id" : "1",
    "hello": "world"
  },
  {
    "id" : "2",
    "hello": "day"
  }
]
```
`Table HelloWorld`
```
| id | hello |
| 1  | world |
| 2  | day   |
```

## Included modules:
There are several included modules, below are links to the READMEs.  You can also find them in the projects directory.

[Validations](packages/validations/README.md) - This project contains helper cucumber steps and various ways of setting objects.  It additionally performs validations on some of the objects.  This would include things like `Then item "a" is equal to 5` and `When "Hello World" is base64 encoded`

[AWS](packages/aws/README.md) - This project contains cucumber steps to run calls on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Supported features include S3, SynamoDB, SQS.

[API](packages/api/README.md) - This project contains cucumber steps for performing API Calls.

[MySQL](packages/mysql/README.md) - This project contains cucumber steps for calling MYSQL.

[DefaultSql](packages/defaultSQL/README.md) - This project is used to create other sql modules.  Just implement what is in MySQL and read the README to get it set up.

[Preprocessor](packages/preprocessor/README.md) - This contains details about the preprocessor.  It is used to add information in feature files and runs before the feature file would.   

[Core](packages/core/README.md) - This contains details about the core.  If you are attempting to set up your own cucumber steps it is a good place to start.  Specifically for the function `MAFWhen`.  Additionally discusses the parsing of how template literals is done; which is needed to provide easy access to variables within strings.

Variables can be used within almost any step.  These can be used as follows:

Feature: Variable example with api
## Hello World API Example

`./features/HelloWorldAPI.feature`
```
Feature: View the text "Hello World"
  Scenario: Hello World
    Given set "url" to "https://mocky.io"
    Given set "exampleLiteral" to "${5+5}Works?"
    When api request "helloWorld.json" is performed
    Then status ok
    And "${response}" is equal to "Hello World"
```
`./helloWorld.json`
```
{
  "url": "${url}",
  "api": "5ec540242f00004cb1dc30dd",
  "method": "GET"
}
```

## Add a module
Please view [AddModule](./AddModule.md) for information on how to add a module.  This will allow the creation of new steps that can be used in your project.
